[Zephir][0] - is a high level programming language that eases the creation and maintainability of extensions for PHP.
Zephir extensions are exported to C code that can be compiled and optimized by major C compilers such as gcc/clang/vc++.
Functionality is exposed to the PHP language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build Zephir compiler you need the following requirements:

#### POSIX

- A C compiler such as  [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) >= 7.0.0 or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org) >= 4.0.0
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/) 3.11 or later
- Library for easy read/write for Yaml data: [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) >= 0.6
- Library for logging: [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) >= 1.4
- Python 3 (Optional: To use [`cmake-format`](https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format))
- C++ language standard support: C++17

If you're using Ubuntu, you can install the required packages this way:

```shell script
# on Ubuntu libspdlog-dev is available from 16.04
sudo apt-get install \
    gcc \
    cmake \
    pkg-config \
    build-essential \
    libspdlog-dev \
    libyaml-cpp-dev
```

On macOS you will need to use brew with a command as follows:
```shell script
brew install cmake pkg-config yaml-cpp spdlog
```

Please note that specific versions of libraries and programs at the time of reading this guide may vary.

### Building from Source

#### POSIX

```shell script
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you have to configure Zephir with special flags:

### POSIX

```shell script
cmake -H. \
  -Bbuild \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DZEPHIR_BUILD_TESTING=ON

export ZEPHIR_TESTS_ROOT=$(pwd)/tests

cd build
make
ctest --output-on-failure
```

Environment variable `ZEPHIR_TESTS_ROOT` is needed for those tests which reads fixture files from the disk.

### Additional cmake flags

Additional cmake flags are (e.g. to enable `FEATURE` use `-DFEATURE=ON`):

| Description                                         | Flag                   |
| --------------------------------------------------- |------------------------|
| Add `cppcheck` step to the compilation.             | `CPPCHECK`             |
| Generate code coverage report.                      | `CODE_COVERAGE`        |
| Compile with all warnings for the major compilers.  | `ENABLE_ALL_WARNINGS`  |
| Enable Effective C++ warnings.                      | `ENABLE_EFFECTIVE_CXX` |

### Generate HTML code coverage report

### Prerequisites

To enable test coverage reports you need the following requirements:

- Gcc: `lcov`, `genhtml`
- Clang: `llvm-profdata`, `llvm-cov`

Follow these steps:
 
1. Build project using `-DCODE_COVERAGE=ON`
2. Run tests
3. Call `make ccov-all` inside the `build` directory

## Internals

#### Conventions

##### Naming

The most important consistency rules are those that govern naming.
This Project uses [Google Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Naming).

##### CMake

1. Do no use `$ENV{VAR_NAME}`, prefer `-DVAR_NAME[=VALUE]`.

#### Library dependencies graph
